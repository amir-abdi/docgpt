## Installation
```bash
pip install docgpt
```

### API Key
DocGPT depends on the GPT3 model, hence the name, trained and served by OpenAI.  
Register for an account and get your API key here: https://openai.com/api/  
Check [OpenAI's Pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) and use it responsibly 
(roughly speaking, auto-documenting 4 pages of code with `docgpt` costs $0.05 USD).

Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, or specify via `--api_key` flag. The key will get
cached in `~/.docgpt` for future use.
